# About

This is a quick local web app. It shows your vk friends, sorted by the last interaction date.

You get to see who you never talk with, who you haven't talked to since 2000. 
And a big red button to delete them from your friend list.

# Running it

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000`. 

Follow instructions.
